{"body":"## NewsClassifier\r\nNewsClassifier is a web application for analyzing potentially large quantities of electronic documents, i.e. web pages or news feeds. NewsClassifier provides a framework for automatically retrieving news articles from RSS feeds, extracting relevant text from messy websites and archive them for later analyses. You can use NewsClassifier as a frontend for manual and automatic (using keywords or regular expressions) coding. It supports unlimited users, news sources and categories. You can run automatic reliability tests and export all results as standard CSV files.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nNewsClassifier is a Rails application, so installation is fairly standard. \r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.9.2 or later (I recommend using RVM)\r\n* Redis/Resque\r\n* MySQL/PostgreSQL/Sqlite\r\n\r\nYou also need to have Python 2.6+ installed for the BTE tool.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nInstall the necessary bundles, create the db, go:\r\n\r\n\t$ bundle install --deployment\r\n\t$ vim config/database.yml\r\n\t$ vim config/config.yml\r\n\t$ rake db:setup\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nYou can manage multiple projects with NewsClassifier, each with its own users, sources, documents and categories. NewsClassifier comes with a demo project as a fallback option, but it is recommended to create a new project for production purposes.\r\n\r\nStart the web server and resque via foreman:\r\n\r\n\t$ foreman start\r\n\t\r\nAfter  starting the server, you can access it at http://localhost:5000. You might need to update your hosts file for local testing with multiple projects and setup your web server in production.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nNewsClassifier is Free Software and licensed under the Affero General Public License 3 (AGPL).\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n&copy; 2008-2012 by Michael Scharkow <michael@underused.org>","note":"Don't delete this file!
